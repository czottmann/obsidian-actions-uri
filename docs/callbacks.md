# [Actions URI](README.md) ‚â´ Getting data back from Actions URI

All routes support return calls back to the sender. This is done by passing callback URLs as parameters, e.g.:

```
obsidian://actions-uri/note/get
  ?vault=My%20Vault
  &file=My%20super%20note
  &x-success=my-app://success
  &x-error=my-app://error
  &call-id=9c2d1bff
```

This example call (formatted for better readability) contains five parameters: `vault`, `file`, `x-success`, `x-error` and `call-id`.  The latter three are needed to provide a callback to the sender.

- `x-success` contains a base URL for returning success information
- `x-error` contains a base URL for returning failure information
- `call-id` contains a unique ID specified by the sender (optional).

When Actions URI has completed the work requested by the incoming call, it'll build a callback URL from the value of either `x-success` or `x-error`. To the base URL the search parameters will be added, containing both the requested data (prefixed with `result-`) and the `call-id` (prefixed with `input-`), then the outgoing call is made.  The receiver can then use that `input-call-id` parameter to pair the result with the original request.  (The value of the parameter is arbitrary, it will be returned as-is.)

Let's continue with the above example.  Assuming the file `My super note.md` exists in vault `My Vault` and contains both front matter and the note body *"Actions URI is ready for action!"*, Actions URI would make a callback to the following URL (formatted for better readability):

```
my-app://success
  ?result-body=%0AActions+URI+is+ready+for+action%21
  &result-content=---%0Atags%3A+test%0A---%0A%0AActions+URI+is+ready+for+action%21
  &result-filepath=My+super+note.md
  &result-front-matter=tags%3A+test%0A
  &input-call-id=9c2d1bff
```

The successful callback contains the full note content (`result-content`), the note body (`result-body`), the note's file path (`result-filepath`) and its front matter (`result-front-matter`) as well as the aforementioned call ID.

But assuming the note does **not** exist, the resulting call would be:

```
my-app://error
  ?error=Note+couldn%27t+be+found
  &input-call-id=9c2d1bff
```


## Important note on callback parameters
**The on-success callback parameter structure varies depending on the endpoints.** See the relevant [endpoint descriptions](README.md#routes-added-by-actions-uri) for details.

On-error callbacks always have the same parameter structure.


## Debug mode
With `debug-mode` enabled in the incoming request (see section ["Parameters required in/ accepted by all calls" in the main doc](README.md#parameters-required-in-accepted-by-all-calls)), the on-success callback of the above example would look like this:

```
my-app://success
  ?result-body=%0AActions+URI+is+ready+for+action%21
  &result-content=---%0Atags%3A+test%0A---%0A%0AActions+URI+is+ready+for+action%21
  &result-filepath=My+super+note.md
  &result-front-matter=tags%3A+test%0A
  &input-action=actions-uri%2Fnote%2Fget
  &input-call-id=9c2d1bff
  &input-file=My+super+note.md
  &input-silent=false
  &input-vault=Testbed
```

It's called "debug mode" because it's good for when you develop an external *whatever* communicating with Obsidian via Actions URI.  In production you'll probably want to pair the callbacks to the original requests using the call ID.  I'm not aware of any drawbacks keeping debug mode on in live code, however.  You do you! üññüèº
