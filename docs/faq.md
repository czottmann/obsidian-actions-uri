# FAQ

## Why does this exist?
One major reason is an upcoming project of mine, for which I need a way to access my vault data from "the outside".  The existing options either didn't fully cut it ‚Äî like [Obsidian URI](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Using+obsidian+URI) ‚Äî or were pretty full of features but left me wanting anyways, like [Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) which does *a lot* but in a way and format that didn't quite gel with me. (Additionally, its author doesn't actually use it anymore themselves[^1] which in my eyes makes it a gamble to rely on it for a new project.)  This is not meant as a diss, mind; it's just not the right thing for me, personally.
