# What does Actions URI do?

Obsidian natively supports a custom URI protocol `obsidian://` which can be used to trigger various actions within the app.  This is commonly used on macOS and mobile apps for automation and cross-app workflows.

**This plugin adds new `x-callback-url` endpoints** to Obsidian so that external sources can better interact with an Obsidian instance by making `GET` requests to a `obsidian://actions-uri/*` URL.  All new routes support `x-success` and `x-error` parameters as a way of communicating back to the sender.  See below for detailed documentation.

It is a clean, somewhat super-charged addition to Obsidian's [own URI scheme](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Using+obsidian+URI#Using+Obsidian+URIs).
