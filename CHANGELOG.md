# Release history

## 1.5.0, 2024-02-__

### New stuff

- New route path: [`/file`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/file/) for working with non-note files. While the Obsidian API doesn't allow for uploading attachment files, you can now at least list, open, delete, or rename them. (#85)
- New route: [`/note/touch`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#notetouch) sets the modification date of a note to the current date and time (force Obsidian to reload it in views/ embeddings).


### Changes

- [`/command/execute`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/command/#commandexecute) no longer requires the `x-success` and `x-error` parameters to be present. If they are, they will be used, but if they are not, the route will still work. (#84)
- Appending below headline: Now inserts before any trailing new lines in a section instead of after them.
- Removed route: `/vault/list-folders` was marked as deprecated in 0.16, and is now gone for good. Use [`/folder/list`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/folder/#folderlist) instead.


### No longer broken

TODO


## 1.4.2, 2023-12-12

### No longer broken

- Resolves problems with applying templates of the core plugin Templates.
- Fixes broken handling of `silent` parameter in `note/*`, `daily-note/*`, `weekly-note/*`, `monthly-note/*`, `quarterly-note/*`, and `yearly-note/*` routes


## 1.4.0, 2023-11-22

### New stuff

#### Support for Note Properties (ZCO-28)

[Properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties) are a core feature of Obsidian: structured data containing information about a note. Actions URI now supports them in a variety of ways. Please see the new route docs for details:

- [`/note-properties`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note-properties/)

Existing routes which return note content now also return note properties, if present. Their documentation has been updated accordingly. See Changes, below.


### Changes

Actions URI now requires Obsidian 1.4+.

The following routes return an additional `result-properties` parameter if the note contains properties:

- [`/note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#notecreate)
- [`/note/get`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#noteget)
- [`/daily-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-notecreate)
- [`/daily-note/get-current`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-noteget-current)
- [`/daily-note/get-most-recent`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-noteget-most-recent)
- [`/weekly-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/weekly-note/#weekly-notecreate)
- [`/weekly-note/get-current`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/weekly-note/#weekly-noteget-current)
- [`/weekly-note/get-most-recent`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/weekly-note/#weekly-noteget-most-recent)
- [`/monthly-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/monthly-note/#monthly-notecreate)
- [`/monthly-note/get-current`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/monthly-note/#monthly-noteget-current)
- [`/monthly-note/get-most-recent`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/monthly-note/#monthly-noteget-most-recent)
- [`/quarterly-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/quarterly-note/#quarterly-notecreate)
- [`/quarterly-note/get-current`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/quarterly-note/#quarterly-noteget-current)
- [`/quarterly-note/get-most-recent`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/quarterly-note/#quarterly-noteget-most-recent)
- [`/yearly-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/yearly-note/#yearly-notecreate)
- [`/yearly-note/get-current`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/yearly-note/#yearly-noteget-current)
- [`/yearly-note/get-most-recent`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/yearly-note/#yearly-noteget-most-recent)


## 1.3.1, 2023-10-09

### Fixes

- Append/prepend to a periodic note that had to be created first would create the note but fail to append/prepend the text. This is now fixed.


## 1.3.0, 2023-09-04

### New stuff

#### Support for triggering Obsidian commands (#77)

Please see the new route docs for details:
  - [`/command`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/command/)

#### Support for Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly Notes (#75)

All of Action UR's existing [`/daily-note`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/) functionality is now also available for anything supported by the [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) community plugin! Please see the new route docs for details:

  - [`/weekly-note`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/weekly-note/)
  - [`/monthly-note`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/monthly-note/)
  - [`/quarterly-note`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/quarterly-note/)
  - [`/yearly-note`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/yearly-note/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Known issue:** At the time of writing, the Periodic Notes plugin seems to have a bug that (for some people) prevents creating a new weekly note on any day other than Sunday. [liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes Â· #185 Â· Open weekly note only works on Sunday](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes/issues/185). Since Actions URI uses the Periodic Notes plugin's API, this is not something I can fix. Please follow the issue for updates.

### Changes

- Actions URI now requires Obsidian 1.3+ .

### Fixes

- Adds missing return calls to `/vault/open` and `/vault/close`. (#76)
- For some Dataview `TABLE` queries, the results would be wrapped in an extra array, this has been fixed. (#79)

### Housekeeping

- Updates esbuild and @typescript-eslint packages.



## 1.2.5, 2023-08-29

### Fixes

- Ensures Dataview `TABLE` results are correctly nested. (#79)


## 1.2.4, 2023-08-07

### Fixes

- Appending/prepending below headlines no longer fails if there is no empty line below the headline. (#73)
- When using a file path ending in `.canvas`, Actions URI will no longer add `.md` to it. (#74)


## 1.2.3, 2023-07-25

### Fixes

- Attempting to use the Templates core plugin on iOS would result in an error. This is now fixed.


## 1.2.2, 2023-07-13

### Fixes

- Adjusts the behavior of [`/note/get`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#noteget) so it no longer breaks Actions for Obsidian's "Check if note exists" action. ðŸ˜¬
- Fixes a bug in note creation where the default behavior regarding content insertion was not respected.


## 1.2.0, 2023-07-12

### New stuff

#### [`/note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#notecreate)

- Adds support for applying a Templates (core plugin) template or Templater (community plugin) template after note creation (#69)

#### [`/note/append`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#noteappend)

- Adds an optional `create-if-not-found` parameter for avoiding errors if the note doesn't exist yet (#67)
- Adds an optional `below-headline` parameter for appending text not to the end of a file but to a section below a heading (#68)

#### [`/note/prepend`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#noteprepend)

- Adds an optional `create-if-not-found` parameter for avoiding errors if the note doesn't exist yet (#67)
- Adds an optional `below-headline` parameter for prepending text not to the beginning of a file but to a section below a heading (#68)

#### [`/daily-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-notecreate)

- Adds support for applying a Templates (core plugin) template or Templater (community plugin) template after note creation (#69)

#### [`/daily-note/append`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-noteappend)

- Adds an optional `create-if-not-found` parameter for avoiding errors if the note doesn't exist yet (#67)
- Adds an optional `below-headline` parameter for appending text not to the end of a file but to a section below a heading (#68)

#### [`/daily-note/prepend`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-noteprepend)

- Adds an optional `create-if-not-found` parameter for avoiding errors if the note doesn't exist yet (#67)
- Adds an optional `below-headline` parameter for prepending text not to the beginning of a file but to a section below a heading (#68)

### Changes

- Incoming, malformed calls are now answered if possible: if an `x-error` parameter was passed in, it will be used now, instead of Actions URI just doing nothing. (#72)
- `file` & `folder` parameter validation is now more strict where the parameter is supposed to reference an existing path, and will return a "bad request" error if the referenced file/folder couldn't be found. Examples for clarification: `file` in `/note/rename`, `folder` in `/folder/delete`; but **not** `file` in `/note/create` (as here the parameter references a file yet to be created). (#72)

### Removals

- The deprecations made in 0.18.0 are now feasting with the Gods.


## 1.1.2, 2023-05-10

This is a minor release aimed at fixing an issue with opening notes after creation that came up during the [Actions for Obsidian](https://obsidian.actions.work) iOS TestFlight.

- [FIX] Cleans up opening/focussing notes
- [DEL] Removes outdated API references


## 1.1.0, 2023-05-04

The plugin is stable enough and used in production as the companion plugin to my macOS/iOS app [Actions for Obsidian](https://obsidian.actions.work). So the version number took a big leap to bring it mostly in line with the app. **Nothing else will change,** Actions URI will remain FOSS under a MIT License.

### New stuff

- If you're unhappy with the global search, and use Omnisearch, you'll be delighted about the [new `/omnisearch` routes](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/omnisearch/) (#59)
- Actions URI should now handle unexpected exceptions outside its control more graceful (#60)
- I've added table of contents to [the route pages in the documentation](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/).

### No longer broken

- Adds code for preventing a race condition in vaults w/ Templater enabled (#61)


## 0.18.0, 2023-04-14

### New stuff

The [`/note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#notecreate) route
has a new optional `if-exists` parameter to specify a strategy for dealing with an existing note. It
overrides the default behavior (creating a new note by appending a numeric suffix to the base name)
and can be set to `skip` or `overwrite`. `if-exists=skip` will not create another note and instead
return the named note as-is. `if-exists=overwrite` will replace the existing note with a new one.

The[`/daily-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-notecreate)
route has a new optional `if-exists` parameter to specify a strategy for dealing with an existing
current daily note. It overrides the default behavior (returning an error) and can be set to `skip`
or `overwrite`. `if-exists=skip` will pretend the existing note was just created and return it.
`if-exists=overwrite` will trash the existing note and create a new daily note from scratch.


### Changes

- [`/note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/note/#notecreate): the
  `overwrite` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use
  `if-exists=overwrite` instead.
- [`/daily-note/create`](https://czottmann.github.io/obsidian-actions-uri/routes/daily-note/#daily-notecreate):
  the `overwrite` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use
  `if-exists=overwrite` instead.
